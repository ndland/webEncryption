## WebEncryption Tool

The purpose of the utility is to be able to upload a file, chose your level of encryption
and then have it return an encrypted file to you. Ideally it would interface with
[Evernote](http://evernote.com), so that we could create new notes with files that
 are encrypted for an added layer of security.
